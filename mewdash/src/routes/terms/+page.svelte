    <h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold">Terms of Service for Mewdeko</h1>

    <p>
      By using Mewdeko, you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and
      conditions ("Terms of Service").
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Service Termination</h2>

    <p>
      We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without
      prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including, without
      limitation, if you breach the Terms. All provisions of the Terms which by
      their nature should survive termination shall survive termination,
      including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers,
      indemnity and limitations of liability.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Changes To The Service</h2>

    <p>
      We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these
      Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will make reasonable
      efforts to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking
      effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole
      discretion.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Arbitration</h2>

    <p>
      In the event of any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising from
      or relating to the Terms of Service or the breach thereof, the parties
      hereto shall use their best efforts to settle such disputes, claims,
      questions, or disagreement. To this effect, they shall consult and
      negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual
      interests, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution satisfactory to
      both parties. If they do not reach such solution within a period of 60
      days, then upon notice by either party to the other, disputes, claims,
      questions, or differences shall be finally settled by arbitration
      administered by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in accordance
      with the provisions of its Arbitration Rules.
    </p>
